            Deepface is a lightweight face recognition and facial attribute analysis (age, gender, emotion and race)
            framework for python. It is a hybrid face recognition framework wrapping state-of-the-art models: VGG-Face,
            Google FaceNet, OpenFace, Facebook DeepFace, DeepID, ArcFace and Dlib. The library is mainly based on Keras
            and
            TensorFlow.

        <p>
            A modern face recognition pipeline consists of 4 common stages: detect, align, represent and
            verify. Deepface handles all these common stages in the background. You can just call its verification, find
            or
            analysis function in its interface with a single line of code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Face detection and alignment are early stages of a modern face recognition pipeline. OpenCV haar cascade,
            SSD, Dlib and MTCNN methods are wrapped in deepface as a detector. You can optionally pass a custom detector
            to functions in deepface interface. MTCNN is the default detector if you won't pass any detector.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deepface also offers facial attribute analysis including age, gender, facial expression (including angry,
            fear, neutral, sad, disgust, happy and surprise) and race (including asian, white, middle eastern, indian,
            latino and black) predictions. Analysis function under the DeepFace interface is used to find demography of
            a face.
